# About the course

With [this](https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/react-automatizando-testes) course I wanted to learn how to test my react applications using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/).

## Course Goals

- Make sure all my components and functionalities are working as expected;
- Lean the [two most popular](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/technologies/testing/) tools for testing React projects.
- Understand what needs and what doesnâ€™t need to be tested;

## Running the project

First you should add the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

then run the backend project:

```bash
npm run backend
```

And finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

## Starter code (Banking project)

We started with a [code](https://github.com/alura-cursos/1976-react-testes) of an Online Banking application that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
